# StyLess Boosts Transferability

This repository will contain the code for the paper "StyLess: Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Examples" (CVPR 2023).

Our paper can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11579) or the [CVPR version](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liang_StyLess_Boosting_the_Transferability_of_Adversarial_Examples_CVPR_2023_paper.html). We've also provided a [presentation video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYu7pyOIt7E). Check it out! If you want to take a look at the slides or poster, you can find them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pytxswCsaNGNxzz2R9SaOcRsDGxDDFnf?usp=sharing).

I finally have time to clean up my code, and I will upload it in the next few days. By the way, we welcome you to meet us at our poster session during the CVPR conference. Our paper tag is TUE-PM-387.
